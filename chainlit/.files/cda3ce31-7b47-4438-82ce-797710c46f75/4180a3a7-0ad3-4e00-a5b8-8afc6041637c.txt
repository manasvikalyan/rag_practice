methods.   
• Fine-tuned models using a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms (Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine ), advanced neural 
networks (BiLSTM, Fully Connected Neural Network), and transformer -based models (BERT, RoBERTa) to evaluate  performance metrics such as 
precision, recall, F1 -score  for the classification task and ROUGE, BERTScore for summaries  generated.
